# Phonebook Application
The Phonebook Application is a simple web-based tool that allows users to manage their contacts by adding, displaying, and searching for contacts' information. The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and utilizes the Bootstrap library for styling.

## Features
Add Contact: Users can add new contacts to the phonebook by entering their name, surname, and mobile number. The application enforces a specific format for mobile numbers (e.g., "081-365-9535").

Display Contacts: The application displays the list of contacts in a table format. Each contact's name, surname, and mobile number are displayed in separate columns.

Search Contacts: Users can search for specific contacts using the search bar. As the user types in the search bar, the application dynamically filters and displays the contacts that match the search query. The search functionality is case-insensitive and considers both the contact's name and surname.

Delete Contacts: Each contact displayed in the table has a "Delete" button. Clicking this button removes the contact from the phonebook.

## Usage
Adding Contacts: To add a new contact, enter the person's name, surname, and mobile number in the provided input fields. The mobile number should be in the format "081-365-9535". Click the "Add Contact" button to save the contact.

Displaying Contacts: The added contacts will be displayed in a table format, showing the name, surname, and mobile number.

Searching Contacts: Use the search bar at the top to search for contacts. As you type, the application will filter and display the contacts that match the search query.

Deleting Contacts: To remove a contact, click the "Delete" button next to the contact's information in the table. The contact will be removed from the phonebook.
